## Scenario

The local zoo is growing fast and needs an effective database system to store records about the animals and zoo employees.

Animals are located in different sections: Africa, Asia, North America, South America, Australia, and some additional ones. Each animal is located in a particular enclosure. An enclosure can be an aviary, cage, barrier, terrarium, etc. There could be several animals in the same enclosure, but the capacity of the enclosure is checked every time an animal is placed. Animals may have children located in the same or other enclosures.

Employees of the zoo include keepers and security guards. Security guards have duty shifts in various sections of the zoo. Keepers take care of the animals' feeding.

Some animals may have a godparent. Any person may become a godparent for any animal. This status implies regular donations for animal care. The name and contact information of the godparents are stored.
